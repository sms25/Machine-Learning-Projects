This ML project can inspect whether the sound emitted from a machine is normal or anomalous. Early detection of anomalous sound can identify any error or defect in the particular machine. 6 dB Fan sounds from MIMII (Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection) dataset are used to train and test the model in the Supervised Learning approach.

## 2. Brain Tumour Detection using Machine Learning

The aim of the project is to detect brain tumour from the MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images of brain. Early detection of brain tumour can reduce the impact of surgery, treatment and improves the prognosis for many patients. Supervised binary classification is used to detect images that are likely to contain brain tumours. A brain tumour dataset from kaggle containing both healthy and brain tumour MRI images is used to train and test the model.
