## 1. Anomalous Sound Detection with Machine Learning
This ML project can inspect whether the sound emitted from a machine is normal or anomalous. Early detection of anomalous sound can identify any error or defect in the particular machine. 6 dB Fan sounds from MIMII (Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection) dataset are used to train and test the model in the Supervised Learning approach.
